# Tools
[TransVar](https://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/transvar/) - a trans-level variant annotator for precision genomics  
[SnpEff](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html) - SnpEff is a variant annotation and effect prediction tool. It annotates and predicts the effects of genetic variants (such as amino acid changes).   
[BISQUE](http://bisque.yulab.org/) - BISQUE (The Biological Sequence Exchange) is a bioinformatics tool enabling locus and variant-specific conversion among human gene, transcript, and protein identifiers from several popular databases. BISQUE implements a graph-traversal algorithm to allow conversion between any two database identifiers, including biologically downstream (gene -> transcript -> protein) and upstream conversions (protein -> transcript -> gene).   
[ANNOVAR](http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/) - ANNOVAR is an efficient software tool to utilize update-to-date information to functionally annotate genetic variants detected from diverse genomes (including human genome hg18, hg19, hg38, as well as mouse, worm, fly, yeast and many others).  
[BioMart](http://www.biomart.org/publications.html) - BioMart is a network database of ENSEMBL,it currently comprises 30 scientific organizations supporting 38 database projects that contain over 800 different biological datasets spanning genomics, proteomics, model organisms, cancer data, ontology information and more.  
[MyVariant.info](https://myvariant.info/) - MyVariant.info provides simple-to-use REST web services to query/retrieve variant annotation data, aggregated from many popular data resources,including dbSNP,dbNSFP,ClinVar,COSMIC,DOCM,EXAC,CIViC,UniProt,Cancer Genome Interpreter,SNPedia,GWAS Catalog and others.
